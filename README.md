# Code Institute Challenges!

## Challenge 1

Using a mobile-first approach, make a webpage responsive in line with the following guidelines. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

Make the div elements 30% of the window size. Now make this change only for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
Set the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
Keep the full-size width for the devices below the 992px
Remove the left and right margin for the devices below the 992px
Remember to keep in mind the mobile-first approach.

## Challenge 2

Test out your new skills by creating a hover effect for a link. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

When hovered a link should change color to the black: #000
Transition speed should be set to 1 second, and transition-timing-function should be ease-in-out
Transition should be triggered by hover

## Challenge 3

Test out your new skills by creating a color change effect. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

Change the background color of the box to the red #e84610 after 1s
The transition should take 1 second and the timing function should be set to ease-in-out

## Challenge 4

Make a ball jump up and down. It should go from top 0px to top 100px. One animation cycle should take half of a second and the animation should run infinitely. Name your keyframe jump. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

## Challenge 5

Make an image double in size when you hover over it but donâ€™t make it jump. Use a transition to make the transformation smooth. The transition should happen within 1 second, and the transition-timing-function should be set to ease-in. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

## Challenge 6

Use the rotate function to spin an image infinitely. The image should rotate without any breaks and stops. Don't forget to give your animation a name! In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.

## Challenge 7

When hovered, move a div with a class of element on X axis by 100% in 1 second. Apply transitions.

## Challenge 8

Bootstrap's core CSS has many other features we haven't mentioned. Let's make use of one and add a new section to our landing page. This section will be called "Monthly favorites" and is going to contain a <table> of information with the top 5 whiskeys of the month. This table should have two columns: "name" and "origin" (the country the whiskey originated from).

## Challenge 9

Let's get to grips with how columns and rows work. To challenge yourself, try to build a grid that displays your name! Think it can't be done? It can! Look at mine first and then check out the code

## Challenge 10

After watching the rest of unit videos from this lesson, try to update just one of the sections of your landing page to look unique. You can use whatever you like to achieve this, and the design can be entirely up to you.

## Challenge 11

Write a mixin called box. It accepts two arguments: size and background-color. The size should be set to width and height should be half of the size. Create a box class that will include that mixin. Pass 200px as a value for the size and #bada55 color for the background-color property. Generate the css file with the same name as your scss file.

## Challenge 12

Open the challenge2.scss file. There is a list of the colors. Your task is to generate CSS classes as follows: .container-1, .container-2, .container-3, .container-4. Each of those classes should have one of the colors from the list set as a value for the background-color property. Use any of the loops you want!

## Challenge 13

Your challenge is to review a code snippet and improve it. Use the hint tab to access the boilerplate files. Open the file called challenge3.scss.

Is something wrong with this code? How can we improve it? Is something repetitive? Maybe a straightforward placeholder can help us out...

## Challenge 14

Open the index.html file. Change the color of all anchors on hover to red in the unordered list with a class listRight that is a child of the container. Use the nesting and the & selector.
